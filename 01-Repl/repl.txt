What is REPL in Node.js?

REPL stands for:
R - Read
E - Eval (Evaluate)
P - Print
L - Loop

In simple words:
REPL is like a playground in Node.js where you can type and run code line-by-line and see results immediately. It's used for quick testing and learning.

How to Start REPL:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type: node
3. You'll enter REPL mode (you'll see > prompt).

How REPL Works:
1. Read – Takes your input (example: 2 + 2)
2. Eval – Evaluates the input (gives 4)
3. Print – Prints the result (shows 4)
4. Loop – Goes back to waiting for more input

Example:
> 2 + 3
5

> const x = 10
undefined

> x * 2
20

How to Exit REPL:
Type .exit or press Ctrl + C two times.

Use REPL to test small JavaScript or Node.js code easily!
